# Proposed Ideas/Brainstorming

## General

- Simple table showing differences in stats between dates
- Scrapes may occur daily, however emails will be weekly
- Since this is a web app, email summary should provide summary of last week, but also have a link to page showing same or expanded details of that week
- Top level view with totals (dashboard welcome)
- Form to easily add/remove tags that are searched for in posts?
- The state of spreadsheet in Google Drive should always be the most up-to-date
- We could implement a check to verify a scrape return desired data before overwritting google spreadsheet

## Scraping

- Scrape resource?
- Scrape action, scrape with (choose spreadsheet dropdown) i.e.(X data worksheet and Y map worksheet) (named range functionality)
- Show urls that will be scraped before scraping
- Show scrape progress (AJAX)
- Show scrape results before saving to Google doc??

# Changelog

## 86c5013
- Spreadsheets resource
    * There is now a `spreadsheets` table in database
    * A form for creating and editing spreadsheets exists
    * The form validates a spreadsheet key through the Google API
    * The form does NOT validate the data and map worksheet GIDs
    * However, it only allows them to be set from a dropdown generated from the referenced spreadsheet from the Google API once the key has been persisted
    * Spreadsheets all have edit and delete links
    * Spreadsheets all have links to the relevant Google Docs
