        You may now create a spreadsheet, scrape and
        upload data to your Google spreadsheets
      </div>
      <br>

      <h4>
        Creating Spreadsheets
      </h4>
      <p>
        A spreadsheet can be created by providing it's key (ID).
        This can be found in the spreadsheet URL:
      </p>
      <pre>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<span style="color:red;">SPREADSHEET_ID_IS_HERE</span>/edit#gid=0</pre>
      <p>
        Once the spreadsheet is created you will need to
        select the worksheet to use as the map and the
        worksheet to which data will be saved.
        This can be done via the <code>Edit Spreadsheet Reference</code> form.
        Each worksheet is represented by it's title and GID also available in the URL:
      </p>
      <pre>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<span style="color:red;">SPREADSHEET_ID_IS_HERE</span>/edit#gid=<span style="color:red;">GID_HERE</span></pre>
      <p>
        After creating a spreadsheet and selecting
        a map/data worksheet you're now ready to
        create a scrape.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>
        Creating Scrapes
      </h4>
      <p>
        A scrape is created simply by selecting the
        spreadsheet you wish to use from the provided
        dropdown.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warning">
        NOTE: You cannot create a scrape unless the
        selected spreadsheet has a set map/data worksheet.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>
        Running and Uploading Scrapes
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Run a new quora scrape:
          <code>rake scrape:quora</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Upload data from the last scrape:
          <code>rake scrape:upload</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Perform a scrape and upload concurrently:
          <code>rake scrape:auto</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4>
        Viewing Scrape Results
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once a scrape is finished, the data
        is saved as JSON to the database.
        This can be viewed in the scrapes index
        by clicking <code>Show Data</code>
        on the scrape you wish to view.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also upload the data from the scrape
        index with the <code>Upload Scrape Data</code>
        button.
      </p>
      <p class="text-info">
        NOTE: Scraping is not available via a form
        due to the process being too long to avoid
        an HTTP timeout.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also open the spreadsheet
        via the provided links in the
        spreadhsheet index.
